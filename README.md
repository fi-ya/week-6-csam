Deployment: Chun<br>
Facilitator: Antonio<br>
User: Safia<br>

### User Story

- As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
- As a user, I want to: be the only person allowed to delete my stuff

---

### User Journey

An example:
landing page - welcome / sign in /register link
post page - form for post, all posts visable
create user page- register form

An example
homepage - can view posts , login/sign up button
login page - form - redirect to homepage
sign up page - form - redirect to homepage

### Issues with Deploy to Heroku

Stop local server
- killall node

In terminal run
- git:remote -a name-of-app
- git push heroku main

ERROR - build failed
`! [remote rejected] main -> main (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/week6-authentication.git'`

---

Solution 1:
- deploy through git hub using repo name
- press connect
- press deploy branch
- build failed - same error

Solution 2:
- settings - buildpack - add node.js
- deploy branch using github
- build failed

---

Solution 3:
- search VS code for unexpected token `<`
- left over from merge conflicts
- delete node modules
- run npm i

*enable automatic deploy

- deploy branch
- click view :tada:

## **ðŸ’¾Â How to install the project**

1. `git clone`
2. cd into the directory on your computer
3. runÂ `npm i`Â to install node modules
4. RunÂ `npm start`Â to run the website on a nodemon local server on port 3000 ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8000/))
5. You can doÂ `npm test`Â to run tests on handler.js

### Things we learned:

To change a commit message
- git commit --amend -m "new message"

To stash - so not saving but put aside changes
- git stash
- git stash pop - to unstash changes
